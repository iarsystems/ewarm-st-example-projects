@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

In this example, one EXTI line (EXTI15_10) is configured to generate
an interrupt on each falling edge.
In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
    - EXTI15_10 is connected to PC.13 pin
      - when falling edge is detected on EXTI15_10 by pressing Tamper push-button, LED1 toggles once.
        Note that PC.13 pin is connected to 3.3V on the eval board, it goes to 0V 
        when Tamper push-button is pressed.

On STM32H743I-EVAL:
    - EXTI15_10 is connected to Tamper push-button

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32H743I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
